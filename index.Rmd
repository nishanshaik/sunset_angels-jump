# About me
I love data, analytics, R, health economics, public health research, and disease modelling.

Hello, 

I am an MBBS-MPH graduate with governmental, non-governmental, and corporate professional exposure. Adept in research methodologies, health economics, HEOR, biostatistics and public health with a grounding in health financing and health policy.

I love R and thoroughly enjoy working with data. I have been able to expand my understanding to effectively deploy R probabilistic disease modelling, health economic modelling, input-output analysis, programme evaluations, and even web development. This website and all the work that you see on this site are built exclusively using R!

I enjoy teaching and guiding on topics that I have good grip on, namely, R programming, analytics, HEOR and modelling.

If you wish to know more about my interest areas, I would be glad to help in any way I could.
