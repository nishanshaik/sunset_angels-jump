- Choosing the single-arrow icon (third from right) would cause the date and R value for a specific region to be shown on mouse hover. 
- While the two-arrow icon (second from right) would let you see the dates and R values for all the selected regions for a given date simultaneously.

## What is the difference between weekly and daily effective R analysis?
The weekly R reports provides the reader with weekly snapshots of the situation. It assess the effective R for the regions for previous week (Sunday through Saturday) as compared to the the preceding week. Such comparison is presented here with the hope that the decision-maker would be able to assess the progress of the situation using fixed time intervals. Expectation is that the estimates thus generated are more robust as it uses a stochastic smoothing method.

Daily R plots provide the users with a near-runtime situation analysis while also showing how a region has progressed in the past. These estimates use a 7-day simple moving average smoothing. It provides the user with a daily-updated, most recent estimates of effective R for each region.
