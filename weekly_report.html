<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Effective Reproductive Numbers for India</h1>
<h4 class="author">Update 5</h4>
<h4 class="date">31 May 2021</h4>

</div>


<style>
body {
text-align: justify}

<p><br />
</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Effective reproductive number (Rt) is the average number of secondary infections per infectious case in the population. The outbreak will spread rapidly if Rt is greater than 1, while the outbreak will get contained when Rt falls below one.</p>
<p>The instantaneous rate of spread of infection as measure by Rt can be influenced by the biological characteristics of the virus and other social, behavioural and medical factors. An effective vaccine can reduce the number of susceptible individuals in an area bringing down the Rt. Lockdowns, curfews, masking, and other physical distancing measures can also control the Rt by reducing the contacts between individuals that lead to secondary infections.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Daily incidence data of COVID-19 outbreak in India from <a href="https://covid19india.org" class="uri">https://covid19india.org</a> was used to derive the Rt from 16 May 2021 till 29 May 2021 using time-dependent method. Data from 634 districts from 36 states in India was used to assess the Rt at three levels - national, state and district. The daily Rt was smoothed over 7-day intervals to account for the ‘weekend effect’ in testing and reporting of incident cases.</p>
<p>The effective reproduction numbers thus smoothed were compared to each other and the magnitude of Rt from 23 May to 29 May have been interpreted in the tables below.</p>
<p>A weekly change matrix was derived to better understand the change in Rt numbers in the two weeks. Those districts and states whose Rt values increased are classified as ‘worsened’, ‘improved’ is assigned if the Rt decreased, and ‘no change’ if no change was observed. Based on the absolute value of smoothed Rt in the previous week, the observed pattern of spread is classified as ‘increasing’ when Rt is above 1, and ‘getting contained’ if Rt is less than 1. By some chance the Rt is exactly 1, the outbreak spreads linearly and is labelled as ‘endemic’.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="national-level" class="section level1">
<h1>National Level</h1>
<p>Effective reproductive number for India was 0.82 from 16 May to 22 May (week 1). This decreased to 0.76 from 23 May to 29 May (week 2). The Rt is still below 1 - the infection is gradually getting contained, albeit at a slower rate than week 1.</p>

<div id="state-level" class="section level1">
<h1>State Level</h1>
<p>Data from 36 states was included in the analysis. Rt was found to have improved in 21 (58%) states. Rt continues to be above 1 in 5 (14%) states. Worsening in Rt values was observed in 14 (39%) states.</p>

<h1>District Level</h1>
<p>Data from 634 districts from 36 states was used to estimate effective reproduction number for each district. The effective reproductive number improved in 392 (62%) districts, worsened in 231 (36%) and remained unchanged in 11 (2%) of the districts analysed.</p>
<p>The Rt is above 1 and spreading at increased rate in 523 (82%), below 1 and getting contained in 11 (2%) and exactly 1 (spreading endemically) in 100 (16%) of the districts.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>The containment efforts taken may be showing effect as the effective reproductive numbers are seen to be decreasing in a large share of states and districts. Further caution needs to be taken in areas where the Rt or spread is observed to have increased. Given the observation that the effective R value is above 1 in many parts of the country, all possible methods the social and economic situation will permit to contain the spread of infection may be taken.</p>
<p>Based on the reported numbers, last week was the third consecutive time India reported effective R values less than 1. It is now safe to say that the current trends are reason enough to incite hope and guarded optimism towards future trends of the outbreak. The gradual, yet sustained reduction in Rt values in the country calls for sustaining the ongoing efforts, augment them to further reduce the spread. Attention needs to be given in those areas where Rt is above and and has increased as compared to previous week.</p>

<h1>Limitations of this analysis</h1>
<p>Only reported numbers are included in the analysis. Time delays in reporting in certain regions are not accounted for in this analysis. All incidence numbers are taken as is. An attempt has been made to make best use of the data available in the hope that this might help decision makers make better decisions.</p>
<p>The data is downloaded from a crowd-sourced database, and unlike JHU-CSSE datasets, exact documentation of changes in the raw data in the form of github commits are not available. It was noted during the course of the analysis that more recent entries may have been revised. Such revisions have caused the Rt values estimated between 16 May to 22 May to differ from those in the last update.</p>
